        <div class="content">Chanter is a requirements management system.  If you have had to live with Rational DOORS and its proprietary database and 
         how difficult it is to connect to your open source project, then this project is for you.</div>

            <h3 class="title t3">Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>allow users to create, modify and delete modules</li>

                <li>deliver containers for the back-end and front-end</li>
                <li>provide Kubernetes yaml definitions</li>
                <li>ability to import into a new module from MS Excel, MS Word, OpenOffice Calc, CSV, JSON, XML and others</li>
                <li>ability to export modules to MS Excel, MS Word, OpenOffice Calc, CSV, JSON, XML and others</li>
                <li>ability to manage requirements and all the edits, auditing of changes</li>
                <li>ability to baseline the requirements</li>
                <li>ability to compare baselines for a selected module</li>
                <li>perform database backup and restore</li>
                <li>provide connectors to integrate into JIRA, Redmine and other tools</li>
                <li>generate VCRMs given that requirements are linked to tests</li>
                <li>connect to external test suites (Cucumber, Karate, etc)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="title">Why the Name?</h3>
                Wikipedia says "The chanter is the part of the bagpipe upon which the player creates the melody."

                The analogy here is "the requirements are the part of a system which define the final solution."

                I've worked multiple projects where the delivery of the system always ended up going back to the requirements and their interpretation.

                While IBM Rational DOORS is a great tool, it is also proprietary and all the plugins are extremely expensive and difficult to integrate, 
                at least according to the IBM consultants... to have estimates and then completion time.
