         how difficult it is to connect to your open source project, then this project is for you.</div>

            <h3 class="title">Why the Name?</h3>
                Wikipedia says "The chanter is the part of the bagpipe upon which the player creates the melody."

                The analogy here is "the requirements are the part of a system which define the final solution."

                I've worked multiple projects where the delivery of the system always ended up going back to the requirements and their interpretation.

                While IBM Rational DOORS is a great tool, it is also proprietary and all the plugins are extremely expensive and difficult to integrate, 
                at least according to the IBM consultants... to have estimates and then completion time.
